## **Amazon Prime Air: Drone Delivery Strategy Analysis**
### Overview
This project explores the feasibility, scalability, and strategic deployment of Amazon Prime Air, Amazon's drone-based delivery service. The study focuses on business impact, drone technology, demographic and geographic suitability, and supply chain implications—anchored in Massachusetts with emphasis on Cambridge, Worcester, and Springfield.

### Tools & Technologies Used
Data Analysis & Visualization: Microsoft Excel, Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Mapping & GIS: U.S. Census Bureau Data, Freemap tools
Optimization & Forecasting: Statistical modeling, Amazon warehouse data analysis
Drone Technology: Amazon MK30 Drone
Regulatory Compliance: FAA Regulations, Massachusetts Airspace Laws
E-commerce Analysis: Statista, Capital One Shopping, Amazon

### Dimensions Analyzed
#### 1. Online Business Growth
Evaluated Amazon’s domestic & international sales trends.

Identified product categories ideal for drone delivery (e.g., electronics, health, toys).

Assessed the rise of AWS, advertising, and third-party seller services as critical growth drivers.

#### 2. Drone Technology (MK30)
Payload: Up to 5 lbs; Range: ~12.5 miles; Speed: 50 mph.

Equipped with "Detect-and-Avoid" system, AI navigation, noise-reduction propellers.

FAA-certified for BVLOS (Beyond Visual Line of Sight) operations.

Delivers 50,000+ items, including prescriptions, in <60 minutes.

#### 3. Demographic Suitability
Used Massachusetts census data (income, education, age, ethnicity).

Identified Cambridge as the optimal hub: high income, dense population, young demographic.

Estimated 1.7M orders/year in a 12.5-mile drone radius (~4700 orders/day from Cambridge hub).

#### 4. Location Analysis
Geographic mapping using drone speed and 15-minute delivery window.

Total coverage potential: ~28% of MA residents.

### Methodology
Analyzed drone-suitable product segments based on weight and bulk.

Mapped demographic layers and FAA-approved zones.

Calculated delivery coverage, daily order volumes, and warehouse needs.

Cited public data: US Census, FAA, Amazon annual reports, and geospatial tools.

### Strategic Recommendations
Start with rural and grow to urban areas post-evaluation.

Prioritize products <5 lbs and high turnover (e.g., vitamins, books, gadgets).

Invest in public awareness to foster trust and boost adoption.

Consider terrain/weather impact on drone reliability in MA.
