## Dimensions Analyzed

### 1. Online Business Expansion
- Amazon's core business, AWS, and third-party seller services showed steady global growth from 2021 to 2023.
- Product categories such as books, electronics, and health supplements are ideal for drone delivery due to weight and demand.
- Advertising and AWS segments provide high-margin revenue, diversifying risk beyond e-commerce.

### 2. Drone Technology (MK30)
- Capable of carrying 5 lbs at 50 mph with delivery in under an hour.
- Enhanced features: noise reduction, weather resistance, and detect-and-avoid AI.
- FAA-certified for BVLOS operations in residential areas.
- Integrated with existing fulfillment centers and designed for high-density regions.

### 3. Demographic Analysis
- Cambridge offers optimal conditions: young population, high income, and strong tech adaptability.
- Drone delivery acceptance likely higher in educated, urban communities.
- FAA-approved zones mapped to assess airspace compatibility with delivery hubs.

### 4. Geographic & Location Suitability
- 12.5-mile drone delivery radius from Cambridge covers over 1.5M residents (~23% of MA).
- Estimated 4,700 drone-suitable orders/day from Cambridge hub alone.
- Springfield and Worcester analyzed as secondary hubs; offer broader state coverage (~6% combined).
- Terrain, weather, and regulatory constraints acknowledged with mitigation plans.
